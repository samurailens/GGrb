## Issue Creation Guidelines

Please follow this template while creating issues. It will help us in fixing the issue faster by our Dev Team.

If an use case fails due to updating of server API ( like adding new param to an existing request ), please clearly mention the expected new param. It is always safe to limit changes like these.

Issues in functionality will be given utmost priority over cosmetic issues. 
Usability issues are not cosmetic issues. 

Please make use of filters/labels available in issue creation to tag issues appropriately.
